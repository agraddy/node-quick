# node-quick

This document is created quickly and most likely will contain errors.

Pain points:
* Restarting the server
* Need to create tests

Todo/Goals:
* README should be cloned from quick project to quick project. 
* Explain the project. 
* Explain how to setup the project from scratch. 
* Documentation is important (may require full sessions).
* Everything should be built low-level. May test high level libraries to verify functionality but the goal is to eventually use low-level libraries.
